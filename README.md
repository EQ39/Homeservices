### ** The Idea**

HomeService is a digital marketplace that is built with a comprehensive category and an efficient search, find and order process that mirrors a typical e-commerce transaction. It's an android based application that creates an on demand, e-commerce-like experience that makes working with home cleaning and home maintenance freelancers easy for residents around Nyeri town by lowering the time-to-hire for clients compared to traditional offline hiring platforms.
